## Description 
A place to log your workouts for each day, letting you add to your workout or create a new workout. Workouts could have multiple excercises and different types of training. When completed, there is a dashboard with graphs of your previous workout. Also, it will give you a summary with the following:
* Duration
* Exercises performed
* Miles covered
* Weight lifted
* Sets performed
* Reps performed
<!-- What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? -->
